# Modeling and Simulation of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle

# Description
This submission contains the files used in this video on [Modeling, Simulation and Control of an Autonomous Underwater vehicle](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/modeling-and-simulation-of-an-autonomous-underwater-vehicle-1586937688878.html). This submission models a 6-DoF autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a position and velocity controller for the AUV. You can switch between low and high fidelity sensor and environment models based on your application needs.
